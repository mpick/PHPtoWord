PHPtoWord Alpha version - - August 20, 2011

Description: The purpose of this class is to assist in outputting a Word document.  Trying to create an html page that will output to Word is time consuming and solutions as well as information on the web is currently very limited.  The class consists of 

Future Project Plans: 
1) Currently the class is setup so that the only option is the output the document as a file.  I would like to add the ability to display as a webpage as well.  This is easily done but the css needed for the layout to look correct in Word will not appear correct on the web and vica versa. 
2) Need to improve footer function to appear at the true foot of the page.  Right now the footer will appear wherever the current cursor placement is when calling the function. 
3) Need to improve image porportional sizing when only a Width or a Height is given.
4) Need to expand on the capabilities of table and list generation. 
5) Need to clean up the unnecessary style code within the body. 
6) Need to add more Word functionality (Pie Charts, Graphs, Links, Shapes, Bookmarks...)
